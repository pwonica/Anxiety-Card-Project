UI MANAGER
Switches the states between the different scenes (Menu, Card Create, Manage). Uses an enum (with ints) in order to switch states.


CARD CREATION
/// Controls the popup for creating a new card. Allows you to accept user input and then talks with the CardDataController to create new cards
/// to be added into the database


PROCESS OF CREATING A CARD:
- Open the CardCreation Popup
- Input a new task. This is sent to CardDataController which then adds a new card to the database.
- To display the card, the CardDataController also adds a new UI element


PROCESS OF DRAWING A CARD 
- CardDrawController controls this process.
- When drawing, get a random card from the deck. Then you will see that task and be called on to do it.
